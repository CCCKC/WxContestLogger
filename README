WxContestLogger is a ham radio contest logging application written in python.

Currently, I'm prototyping individual features in separate folders.

features:
	WxWidgets based UI
	network support
		local network discovery - no goofy windows workgroups misconfiguration
		network updates are single UDP frames
		UDP frames are smaller than default 802.11 MTU
		self-syncronizing - two boxes easily share their results
	sane database format - likely SQLite, not ms-access
	log export formats - excel, csv, xml, cabrillo3
	multi-OS support
	not written in VB6!
